The controller class is responsible for handling incoming requests and directing them to the appropriate service method.
The service class performs the business logic and may interact with the repository to retrieve or modify data in the database.
The repository class provides an interface for communicating with the database,
and the model class represents the data
entities in the database.

This flowchart shows the typical flow of data and control through a Spring Data MongoDB application,
 from the user interface to the database and back.
 By separating the concerns of handling user input, business logic, data access, and data representation,
 the application can be more easily maintained and scaled.
