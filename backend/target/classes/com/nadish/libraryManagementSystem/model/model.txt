* THE FIELDS OF MODEL CLASSES ARE THE FIELD OF A TABLE IN THE DATABASE
* IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE NAME & TYPE OF FIELD IN MODEL CLASS ARE SAME AS THOSE IN FIELD IN DATABASE DOCUMENT

Model classes in Spring Data MongoDB represent the data model of an application. They define the structure and behavior
 of the entities being stored in a MongoDB database.

A model class typically has instance variables that represent the attributes of the entity being modeled, along with
 getters and setters to access and modify those attributes. The class may also have additional methods that provide
 business logic or perform calculations based on the data stored in the model.

When you define a model class in Spring Data MongoDB, you are essentially defining the schema for the corresponding
 MongoDB collection. The fields in the model class correspond to the fields in the MongoDB document, and the types of
 the fields in the model class determine the data types of the corresponding fields in the document.

Spring Data MongoDB uses reflection to map the fields in the model class to the fields in the MongoDB document, so
 it is important that the names and types of the fields in the model class match the names and types of the fields in
  the document.

Overall, model classes play an important role in the Spring Data MongoDB framework by providing a structured and
object-oriented approach to working with MongoDB data.
